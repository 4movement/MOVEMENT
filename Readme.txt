#Installtion

1. Before launching the project locally, make sure your local database has the database named "movement_db". And also import /4_smart0eddie.sql into your database. 

2. The project's default DB user name = "root", password = "root". If your local DB server user name and password are not like these, change them in the /application/config/database.php
