1. Introduction. What is Captcha ( Turing Test )
   A CAPTCHA ( short for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart") is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human. A common type of CAPTCHA requires that the user type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits that appears on the screen. Humans can read the letters quite fast from the image, but computers usually can't.

   The contents of this package:
   captcha/backgrounds // Background images
   captcha/fonts // Fonts
   captcha/configuration.php // The configuration file
   captcha/code.php // The file that choses a random string and generates the image
   captcha/captcha.html // The html code that usually needs to be pasted in web forms
   captcha/whatis.html // A small description of captcha
   

   How does it work

   1. Upload the folder "captcha" to your web server.
   2. Copy and paste the content of the file captcha.html to your webform, just before the submit button.
   3. Check if the entered captcha code is corect in the php file that is doing the form processing.
